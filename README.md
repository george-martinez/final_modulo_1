This project is a challenge to all my current knowledge in Front End Development at 02/21/2022.

The site was built using only three tecnologies: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS.

The objetive of the project is to be the same as possible to the model, trying to learn on the way how to modularize code in CSS3 and asimilate concepts as Selectors, Flexbox, Grid Container, Pseudoclass, Animations, Mobile First and Responsive Design.

I hope you like it :)
